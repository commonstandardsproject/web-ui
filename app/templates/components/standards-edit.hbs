      Standards Creator & Editor
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Are we missing standards you rely on? Has your school, district or charter network created their own custom standards? Add them to the database and make them searchable!
    </h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to the Common Standards Project editing interface. Here, you can add or edit any standard in the database or add your own. Once your standards are in the database, you can share them so your colleagues can easily search them.
    </p>
    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
    <p>
      First, log in or sign up below. Then, add or edit standars using the easy interface. Each time someone submits a change to  the standards, we review it and then save a version. This way, if someone makes a mistake (or edits with the standards you spent hours adding), we can rollback the change. Educator rely on standards to be accurate, so we take the integrity of standards very seriously.
